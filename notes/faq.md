End of Semester CS 212 Project FAQ
==================================

## Note the following from the syllabus and class website

- You are allowed only **one** project submission per week.
- Only one project may be submitted during finals week, and students may only schedule one code review during finals week. Projects must be completed in order.
- You should allow at least two weeks for feedback and revisions before the final code review.
- Do not create a release until you are passing all tests and believe you are prepared for a code review. You may always seek early feedback on your code by visiting office hours.
- :warning: If you ignore an open issue or sign up for code review before you are passing the necessary tests, your final project score will be docked 5 points for each offense.


## Project 3

- There are no more open Project 3 code review slots for the week of 5/2-5/6.
- Creating a release before your solution is passing the appropriate test cases may result in a deduction.

## Project 4

- Code review slots will be available 5/10 - 5/12.
- No Project 4 code review slots will be available on 5/13.
- Only a limited number of slots will be available on 5/12. *Do not rely on being able to schedule for the last possible day.*
- Expect *at least* a 24-hour turnaround time between a submission and feedback/code review sign up. Do not expect that you will be able to sign up for code review on the day following your submission.

## Project 5
- Partial credit may be awarded to solutions that implement only some of the functionality specified.
- To be eligible to receive credit for the additional features you must complete the required features.
- Your server must be running at your assigned node and port prior to code review.

## Project 3 Submission Checklist

- To qualify for Project 3 code review *all* of the following must be true:
 - Solution passes all of the *original* Part 1 test cases (do **not** modify the test cases) 
 - Server is running at your assigned node and port
 - Server responds to all test requests appropriately (e.g., sample searches work and no searches result in a NullPointerException)
 - Thread safety is implemented correctly
 - Packages are used appropriately
 - Code demonstrates good design practices
 - [Style guidelines] (https://github.com/CS212-S16/lectures/blob/master/notes/style.md) are followed

## Project 4 Submission Checklist

- To qualify for Project 4 code review *all* of the following must be true:
 - Server is running at your assigned node and port
 - Server responds to all test requests appropriately (e.g., accounts may be created, favorites may be selected)
 - Code demonstrates good design practices, including separation of server and database connectivity
 - [Style guidelines] (https://github.com/CS212-S16/lectures/blob/master/notes/style.md) are followed
 
## Final Code Review

- Each student will have the opportunity for one code review during finals week.
- You must complete projects in order.
- You are advised to submit your release 24 hours in advance of your code review slot.
- You may sign up for your code review slot now. Sign up [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUlHU015Zm1nellQfGRlZmF1bHR8OWI1ODQyMzY2NjBiMWExMjdmYmYxZGZkNmVjNzU1ZGU).
- It is strongly recommended you confirm your time with the professor. Missed finals week code review appointments may not be rescheduled.
