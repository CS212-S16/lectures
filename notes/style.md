Style Guidelines
================

Your code is expected to follow the style guidelines outined in the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) and also the list of guidelines below. If you do not follow these guidelines you may not qualify for code review on projects and may receive a deduction on homeworks. 

1. Use lower-case letters to begin a variable or method name.
2. Use upper-case letters to begin a class name.
3. Use camelCase not_underscores.
4. Be consistent with spacing. `variable= new Something()` is not good. `variable = new Something()` is much better.
5. Be consistent with your use of the `this` keyword, especially in constructors.
6. Use try-with-resources where possible.
7. Document all of the methods and classes you create.
8. Use private data members unless there is a good reason to do otherwise.
9. Make sure use proper indentation in all classes.
10. Do not catch unchecked exceptions unless there is a very good reason. Instead, try to use conditionals appropriately to avoid unchecked (e.g., NullPointer) exceptions.
11. Do not replicate code unless there is a very good reason.
