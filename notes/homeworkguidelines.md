Homework Guidelines
===================

For your first homework assignment, make sure you have done an [initial clone](githubinstructions.md#initial-clone) of your homework repository. This repository will be named using the convention `<github_username>-homework`, for example `srollins-homework`.

For any subsequent homework assignments, *before beginning work* make sure to pull down any updates the instructor has made to your repository by following the instructions under "Pulling Down New Projects" here: [Github instructions](githubinstructions.md)


##Submission
To submit your homework assignment, make sure the latest versions of *all* Java files are available on Github by the due date.

Homework assignments are due at 11:59pm on the due date.

Follow the [instructions for using Github](githubinstructions.md) to make sure you have uploaded your code correctly.

Use the Github website to make sure you see the latest version of your code there.

Once your code is up on Github, your assignment is officially submitted!

##Testing
All projects provided by the instructor have a `test` directory containing one or more JUnit test classes. To be eligible for full credit, your homework solution must pass all of the tests provided in the repository. You *may* receive some partial credit for partially working solutions, but this applies to homework assignments only. Projects must pass all test cases and also pass the instructor code review to be eligible for any credit.

###Running JUnit Tests Locally
If your Eclipse project is properly setup, you should be able to right-click the appropriate test file and select "Run As->JUnit Test" in the Package Explorer.

##Grading
Your grade will be based on (1) whether you code passes all unit tests and (2) whether your code is well designed. Your code must be demonstrate proper decomposition (into classes and methods), clear implementation, and efficiency.
